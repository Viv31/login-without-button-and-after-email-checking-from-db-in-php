In this code initially only email field is visible to user when user insert email if it is in database it shows border green and message email matched and shows a new field for inserting password  else it shows email is not matched

when user enter right password it automatically redirect to dashborad otherwise it shows error password is not matched.

Note:Here i am not maintaining session for logout purpose.

For testing :
Username:abc@gmail.com
Password:1234
